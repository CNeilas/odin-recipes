            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cups greek yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/3 cup raisins</li>
                <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, Greek yogurt, baking powder, raisins, and cinnamon. Stir until the mixture forms a sticky dough. You can also using a standing mixer for this.</li>
                <li>Lightly flour your surface and knead the dough for about 2-3 minutes until it’s smooth. Add a bit more flour if the dough is too sticky to handle.</li>
                <li>Form the dough into one large ball, then divide it into six equal portions. Roll each piece into a small ball and then shape it into a bagel by poking a hole in the center and gently stretching it out.</li>
                <li>Place the bagels on a lined baking sheet. Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                <li>Allow the bagels to cool slightly, then slice in half and toast for an extra crispy texture. Serve plain or with your toddler’s favorite spreads like cream cheese, butter, or nut butter.</li>
