                <li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice</li>

            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, pumpkin puree, eggs, baking powder, and cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. Stir until all ingredients are well combined. If you want to make the pancakes sweeter, you can add 1 tablespoon of maple syrup or sprinkle in some chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Lightly grease the pan with butter or cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Pour batter onto the skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on one side, until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look firm. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes or until the pancakes are fully cooked through.</li>
                <li>Remove from the pan and let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
            </ol>
